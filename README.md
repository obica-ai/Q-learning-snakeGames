# Q-learning-snakeGames


 This assignment involved implementing a Q-learning agent within a snake game environment to maximize reward acquisition through optimal actions. My responsibilities included designing state and action definitions, updating Q-values using temporal difference learning, and managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off to enhance agent performance.
